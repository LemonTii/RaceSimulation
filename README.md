# Project Title

Race Simulator

## Description

This is a C project that uses multi-threaded systems to simulate a race between two entities. After starting the program the race will begin.
The racer entity will lose health as it goes up and as it collides with the obstacles. By a certain probability, the racer will move down the screen.
If a racer reaches the end, the program will wait until the other racer either dies or reaches the end and announce the winner. If both are dead it will announce a tie.

## Getting Started

You must be able to run C programs on your computer

### Executing program

* In the terminal, use the command <make> to create an executable called "race"
* use the command <./race> to start the program
